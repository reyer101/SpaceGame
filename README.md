# SpaceGame

This repo contains C# scripts and an executable for a simple space shooter Unity game made following this
Unity tutorial: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial

Although the base tutorial was followed, DestroyByContact.cs was modified and StarMover.cs was added to control the 
movement and behavior of star obstacles I created later.

Controls: WASD or arrow keys to move, click to shoot, 'R' to restart after Game Over.

**Note: SpaceGame.exe should run on a Windows machine provided that SpaceGame_Data is present in the same directory.
